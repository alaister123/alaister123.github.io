This project is based on this [IDCIA: Immunocytochemistry Dataset for Cellular Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08992)

My team approached this problem as a object detection task rather than object density estimation. The results were significantly better than object density estimation approaches. Above 60% ACP (AcceptableError Count Percent). The model is currently being used to certain labs to aid student researchers in counting and annotating cells.
